This code is similar to some that I wrote in a production context several years ago. There was a web-app that was being used to view and edit information in a postgres database. Data from the db was also being displayed on a Trello board, with cards representing clients, which could be updated and dragged to different columns based on that client's state. This code, a function called addDeliverablesAsync, is what would sync a client's data with trello when triggered from the web-app. I found this to be a fun exercise, and ended up playing around with the code on my own, manipulating trello and such. Eventually adapting it as a teaching tool, I show the old version of the function to my mentoring students as an example of "callback hell", poor handling of asynchronous code, and generally unmaintainable design. And then my newer functionality as a, hopefully, good example.

My code is at the start. The old, "bad" version starts on line 430, for comparison.
